# p10-football
football timer using arduino and  P10 led panel display.

This code can be used only with ordinary P10 led pannels . The library does not support SMD type led pannels due to scan rete differences.

football.ino code could be used to run a timmer for football from 0:0 to infinity till the power is turned off.
football_twoHalfs.ino code could be used to put up two halfs of the match . The first half stats from 0:0 and goes on till the power is turned off. The second half starts from 30:0 and goes on untill the power is turned off
